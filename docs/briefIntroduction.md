## What is DODO

DODO is a new generation of on-chain liquidity solutions, which uses the proactive market maker algorithm (PMM) to provide pure on-chain and contract-fillable liquidity.

## How does DODO work

DODO accepts Oracle's price guidance and gathers funds near the market price to provide sufficient liquidity. As transaction amount increases, DODO will dynamically adjust the price to encourage arbitrageurs to keep the portfolio of the capital pool unchange.

## What can I do with DODO

### As a trader

- Each and every traders enjoy sufficient liquidity similar to that of centralized exchanges
- Arbitrageurs can make a profit from the price difference between DODO and other exchanges
- Smart contracts can natively use DODO liquidity to complete on-chain transactions such as liquidation, auctions, etc.

### As a liquidity provider (LP)

- There is no limitation on the deposit quantity and asset types
- DODO will charge a commission fee for each transaction and eventually distributed it to LPs
- Create trading pairs of your own tokens. And with even only your own tokens deposited, liquidity can be obtained.
